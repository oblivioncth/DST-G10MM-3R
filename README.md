## Description
G10MM-3R is a drone version of Glommer. Design inspired by Drones from Slime Rancher.  
It can:  
- Pick up various inventory items (uncooked food and resources),  
- Pick resources like Grass, Saplings, Berries, etc.  
  
It will store all its items inside a modified Glommer Statue (dubbed "G10MM-3R Base").  
It doesn't need any fuel - it will work until broken.  
  
You can find its blueprint by mining the Glommer's Statue. In case you missed it, there's also 20% chance of it dropping from Dragonfly/Bee Queen. Also, 1% chance of getting it from hammered Broken Clockwork piles.
